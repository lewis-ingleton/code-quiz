# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

Multiple choice quiz created... but not finished. 

## Aim 

* Using web APIs the user will answer a series of quiz questions 
* Their score will be stored in local storage at the end of the quiz
* The user will be able to enter their initials so that their score will be visible on the high scores page 

## Still to do 

* The submit button is linked to local storage but I still need to confiure when the correct answer is chosen, thereby keeping track of the user's score 
* These high scores will then need to be displayed on the high scores page 
* When a user selects an answer, I need to display 'Correct' or 'Incorrect' messaging, along with the relevant audio file 
* I need to set a countdown timer when the user starts quiz
* I need to deduct 5 seconds from timer when the user selects an incorrect answer
